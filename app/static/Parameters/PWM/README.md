# PWM

The PWM Parameter is used to control the PWM hardware on an mcu physical pin.

Pulse-width modulation (PWM), is any method of representing a signal as a rectangular wave with a varying duty cycle.

PWM is useful for controlling the average power or amplitude delivered by an electrical signal. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by switching the supply between 0 and 100% at a rate faster than it takes the load to change significantly. The longer the switch is on, the higher the total power supplied to the load.

Typically used to control the brightness of LEDs, the speed of motors, the position of hobby servos and more.
