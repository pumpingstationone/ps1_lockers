## Lockers Build

Hey all, just want to make a bit of a schedule and let people know where and when we'll be working so we can best manage the space. And thank you to everyone who voted. 

### General Overview
There are over 500 pieces to make, so will take a bit of time. 
- Woodshop
  - Tablesaw
    - A lot of the work will be done on the tablesaw and each setup will take a few hours. 
  - Shopbot
    - We have about 40 pieces that need holes drilled in from the shopbot and that should be a few hours setup as well. 
  - Miter Saw
    - Anything we can cut on the miter saw will be done there. (500 pcs)
  - Panel Saw
    - Depending how many people we get will change how much we use it, the more people, the more we will try to use something that's not the tablesaw
- Dock
  - Wood delivered 12-23 we hopefully cut all pieces 12-26
- General Area
    - We're making 40' of lockers and shitloads of drawers, so would imagine we'll be taking up the entire area. 
    - Drawer assembly station on the pool table
    - Probably move some of the other tables out or put them together to build large assemblies.
